<ul>
<li>Google-ID (a number unique to each Google user)</li>
<li>The URL of your Google profile picture</li>
<li>... that's it. No email, no name, nothing else</li>

<p>When you log in via the Google login, you, provide consent that we may pull personal data from the <a href="https://v.enl.one/">V</a> and <a href="https://enlightened.rocks/">enlightened.rocks</a> websites. We fetch the following fields for persistent storage in your profile:</p>

<p>This data will be updated every time you actively login. We do not check for updated data unless you log in. We may occasionally refresh the data if we believe it has become corrupt or for testing purposes. We will share your GoogleID, links to your profile at V and .rocks, and blacklist status with other authenticated agents. Additional information will be shared with authenticated agents as you authorize by your team memberships.</p>

<p>You can delete your profile, <a href="/api/v1/me/delete">by clicking this link</a> (warning, there is no confirmation on this). This will remove all the information we have stored concerning you.

<div class="card-header">Hosting</div>
<div class="card-body">
<p>Your data is stored on servers in Dallas, Texas, USA, in datacenters with a high level of security. Database access is only possible for the website owner and not by the hosting company.</p>
<p>Location data is considered stale and purged after 4 hours. Location history is not saved, only the most recent datapoint is stored.</p>
</div>

<div class="card mb-2">
<div class="card-header">Data Usage</div>
<div class="card-body">
<p>Other agents <strong>on your teams</strong> may access your operation and location data. There is no "admin mode" to allow specific users access beyond what you explicitly permit through your team settings. The system administrators can access the database directly for maintainance purposes, but do so only when required for system operation. Location information is stored in different database tables from agent identification information; extra steps are required to associate location information with a particular agent.</p>
<p>Other websites and third-party applications can access your information with the same level of protection as other users: they must be on your teams.</p>

<p>WASABEE does not feature personal profile pages beyond Agent name, Google profile picture, Ingress level and links to V and .rocks profiles.</p>
